2. **Secure Configuration Setup**:
   * Open `config.ini` (in the cloned repository folder) with a secure text editor
   * Never share this file - it contains sensitive credentials
   * Consider encrypting the folder if on a shared computer

**Configuration Template**:
```ini
[Email]
SenderEmail = your_email@gmail.com
SenderPassword = your_16_char_app_password  # Never use regular password
ReceiverEmail = security_alerts@gmail.com   # Can be same or different
SmtpServer = smtp.gmail.com                 # Gmail SMTP (secure TLS)
SmtpPort = 587                              # Standard secure port

[Settings]
Subject = Security Alert: Login Detected on  # Customizable subject line
```

**Alternative Email Providers**:
```ini
# Microsoft Outlook/Hotmail
SmtpServer = smtp-mail.outlook.com
SmtpPort = 587

# Yahoo Mail
SmtpServer = smtp.mail.yahoo.com
SmtpPort = 587

# Custom SMTP (corporate/self-hosted)
SmtpServer = mail.yourdomain.com
SmtpPort = 587  # or 465 for SSL
```

### 4️⃣ **Automate with Task Scheduler**

Set the script to run automatically and silently at every login.

1. Press `Win + R`, type `taskschd.msc`, and hit Enter.
2. In the right panel, click **Create Basic Task...**.
3. **Name**: Give it a name like "Advanced Login Monitor".
4. **Trigger**: Choose **When I log on**.
5. **Action**: Select **Start a program**.
6. **Program/script**: Find `pythonw.exe`. (This runs the script without a black console window).
   * *Tip: In Command Prompt, type `where pythonw` to find the full path.*
7. **Add arguments**: Enter the full path to your script, matching where you cloned the repository (e.g., `"C:\LoginMonitor\webcam-login-monitor_v2.1_Enhanced\monitor.py"`).
8. **Start in**: Enter the path to the cloned repository folder (e.g., `"C:\LoginMonitor\webcam-login-monitor_v2.1_Enhanced"`). This is critical!
9. Click **Finish**.
10. **Final Polish**:
    * Find the task in the main library, right-click it, and select **Properties**.
    * Check ✅ **Run with highest privileges**.
    * Go to the **Conditions** tab and uncheck "Start the task only if the computer is on AC power".
    * Click **OK**.
